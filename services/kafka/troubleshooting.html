<p>The Kafka service will be listed as “Unhealthy” when it detects any underreplicated partitions. This error condition usually indicates a malfunctioning broker. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dcos beta-kafka topic under_replicated_partitions</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">dcos beta-kafka topic describe &lt;topic-name&gt;</code> commands to find the problem broker and determine what actions are required.</p>

<p>Possible repair actions include <code class="highlighter-rouge">dcos beta-kafka broker restart &lt;broker-id&gt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">dcos beta-kafka broker replace &lt;broker-id&gt;</code>. The replace operation is destructive and will irrevocably lose all data associated with the broker. The restart operation is not destructive and indicates an attempt to restart a broker process.</p>

<h1 id="replacing-a-permanently-failed-server">Replacing a Permanently Failed Server</h1>

<p>If a machine has permanently failed, manual intervention is required to replace the broker or brokers that resided on that machine. Because DC/OS Kafka uses persistent volumes, the service continuously attempts to replace brokers where their data has been persisted. In the case where a machine has permanently failed, use the Kafka CLI to replace the brokers.</p>

<p>In the example below, the broker with id <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> will be replaced on new machine as long as cluster resources are sufficient to satisfy the service’s placement constraints and resource requirements.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>```bash
$ dcos beta-kafka broker replace 0
```
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="extending-the-kill-grace-period">Extending the Kill Grace Period</h1>

<p>If the Kafka brokers are not completing the clean shutdown within the configured
<code class="highlighter-rouge">brokers.kill_grace_period</code> (Kill Grace Period), extend the Kill Grace Period, see <a href="managing.md#extend-the-kill-grace-period">Managing - Extend the Kill Grace Period</a>.</p>
