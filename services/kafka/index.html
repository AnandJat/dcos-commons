<p>DC/OS Apache Kafka is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Apache Kafka on Mesosphere DC/OS, eliminating nearly all of the complexity traditionally associated with managing a Kafka cluster. Apache Kafka is a distributed high-throughput publish-subscribe messaging system with strong ordering guarantees. Kafka clusters are highly available, fault tolerant, and very durable. For more information on Apache Kafka, see the Apache Kafka <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html">documentation</a>. DC/OS Kafka gives you direct access to the Kafka API so that existing producers and consumers can interoperate. You can configure and install DC/OS Kafka in moments. Multiple Kafka clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Kafka as a managed service to your organization.</p>
