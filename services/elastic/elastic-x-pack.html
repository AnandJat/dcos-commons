<h1 id="elastic-x-pack">Elastic X-Pack</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html">X-Pack</a> is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package. X-Pack is a commercial product of Elastic that requires a license. By default, X-Pack is not installed as part of the DC/OS Elastic service. However, it’s easy to enable X-Pack as part of the service configuration:</p>

<p><img src="img/x-pack.png" alt="x-pack" /></p>

<p>You must set the update strategy to <code class="highlighter-rouge">parallel</code> when you toggle X-Pack in order to force a full cluster restart.
Afterwards, you can set the update strategy back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">serial</code> for future updates.</p>

<p>You can toggle this setting at any time. This gives you the option of launching an Elastic cluster without X-Pack and then later enabling it. Or, you can run a cluster with X-Pack enabled to try out the commercial features and, if at the end of the 30-day trial period you don’t wish to purchase a license, you can disable it without losing access to your data.</p>

<h2 id="license-expiration">License Expiration</h2>

<p>If you uninstall the X-Pack plugin via the service configuration or you let your license expire, remember these two important points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your data is still there.</li>
  <li>All data operations (read and write) continue to work.</li>
</ol>
