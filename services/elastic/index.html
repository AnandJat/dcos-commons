<p>DC/OS Elastic Service is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Elastic on Mesosphere DC/OS, eliminating nearly all of the complexity traditionally associated with managing an Elasticsearch cluster. Elasticsearch is a distributed, multitenant-capable, full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch clusters are highly available, fault tolerant, and durable. For more information on Elasticsearch, visit the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> site. Multiple Elasticsearch clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Elasticsearch as a managed service to your organization with or without the commercial X-Pack capabilities.</p>
